This blog is a collection of review and summaries of various research papers and topics in the broad field of Machine Learning. Through this, I aim to improve my research paper reading skills, keeping up with a a decent target of a paper a week, document my progress in machine learning while trying to maintain a standard as described in [NeurIPS reviewer guidelines](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2019/PaperInformation/ReviewerGuidelines), although I won't be scoring them since I'm not in any position to judge them.
