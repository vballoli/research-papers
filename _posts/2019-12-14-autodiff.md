## Summary
I've been working with Julia's and Swift's deep learning frameworks: [Flux in Julia](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) and [Swift for Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift) for quite a while, both having the foundation principles: `Automatic Differentiation` in Deep Learning !! Although Julia did release an incredible paper
on Zygote, I found it difficult to understand, probably because my weights are missing a prior ;). I usually understand a paper better if I have a better understanding of the history in the field, that's where I discovered the secret to research: Survey papers. I've begun to appreciate the importance of such papers after reading this particular paper.
A clear explanation and summary is coming up.
